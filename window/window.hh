//  Brief summary :
//
//    2 Main classes are defined here :
//    i4_window_class : 
//    base object for most everything graphical.  
//    An i4_window_class should only draw (using local_image) during draw().
//    During draw(), proper clipping is setup.  
//    local_image will transform local coordinates to global space for you.
//    because a window is derived from i4_event_handler_class, 
//    it can receive events through receive_event (see device/device.hh 
//    for more info on this.  A the base window class does not process any events.
//
//    i4_parent_window_class : 
//    parent windows have a list of children window.  
//    The draw order for children is painter's algorithm.  So the last
//    child in the list gets drawn on top.  parent windows also 
//    maintain a dirty_area list so that redraw can be done
//    more efficiently than redrawing themselves & their children completely.
//    parent windows have a default behavior for responding to a 
//    number of events.  parent windows keep a mouse & keyboard
//    focus.   The mouse focus is set automically through mouse_move events.  
//    The key focus is not implemented yet.
